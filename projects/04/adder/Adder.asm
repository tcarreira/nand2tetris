// This programs takes two one digit numbers as input and calculates their sum,
// putting the result in RAM[0].
// In order to do so, the program should be divided into three sections:
// - Waits for the first number to be pressed and stores it;
// - Waits until nothing is being pressed (to allow the second number to be pressed afterwards);
// - Waits for the second number to be pressed, adds it to the first number and places
// the result in RAM[0]
// Because on each of these sections we have to wait for user input, you should use
// a loop for each section.
// Reminder: We are not adding the key code of each number we press, we are adding the
// value of said number, therefore there needs to be a conversion from key code to
// number value.


// Put your code here
